abstract={We consider the bi-Laplacian eigenvalue problem for the modes of vibration of a thin elastic plate with a discrete set of clamped points. A high-order boundary integral equation method is developed for efficient numerical determination of these modes in the presence of multiple localized defects for a wide range of two-dimensional geometries. The defects result in eigenfunctions with a weak singularity that is resolved by decomposing the solution as a superposition of Green's functions plus a smooth regular part. This method is applied to a variety of regular and irregular domains and two key phenomena are observed. First, careful placement of clamping points can entirely eliminate particular eigenvalues and suggests a strategy for manipulating the vibrational characteristics of rigid bodies so that undesirable frequencies are removed. Second, clamping of the plate can result in partitioning of the domain so that vibrational modes are largely confined to certain spatial regions. This numerical method gives a precision tool for tuning the vibrational characteristics of thin elastic plates.},

abstract={It is well known that the Ciarlet-Raviart mixed method for solving the biharmonic eigenvalue problem with Navier Boundary Condition by decomposing the operator into two Laplacians may generate spurious eigenvalues on non-convex domains. To overcome this difficulty, we adopt a recently developed mixed method, which decomposes the biharmonic equation into three Poisson equations and still recovers the original solution. Using this idea, we design an efficient biharmonic eigenvalue algorithm, which contains only Poisson solvers. With this approach, eigenfunctions can be confined in the correct space and thereby spurious modes in non-convex domains are avoided. A priori error estimates for both eigenvalues and eigenfunctions on quasi-uniform meshes are obtained; in particular, a convergence rate of {\$}{\$}{\{}{\backslash}mathcal {\{}O{\}}{\}}({\{}h{\}}^{\{}2{\backslash}alpha {\}}){\$}{\$}({\$}{\$} 0<{\backslash}alpha <{\backslash}pi /{\backslash}omega {\$}{\$}, {\$}{\$}{\backslash}omega > {\backslash}pi {\$}{\$}is the angle of the reentrant corner) is proved for the linear finite element.

With an increase in the wave number, this wave gradually turns into an analogue of the Konenkov wave, but this happens in the region of very short waves. The dependence on Poisson's ratio (the ``critical'' value of the harmonic number, at which the wave transformation from whispering gallery type to the Konenkov type occurs) is constructed. The certain conditions, under which the transition region does not go beyond the scope of the Kirchhoff theory, are determined.},

The linearized velocity potential theory is adopted for fluid flow, and the thin elastic plate model is applied for the ice sheet. The domain is divided into two subdomains. Inside the harbor, the velocity potential is expanded into a series of eigenfunctions in the vertical direction. The orthogonal inner product is adopted to impose the impermeable condition on the harbor wall, together with the edge conditions on the intersection of the harbor wall and the ice sheet. In the open sea outside of the harbor, through the modified Green function, the velocity potential is written in terms of an integral equation over the surface of the harbor entrance, or the interface between the two subdomains. On the interface, the orthogonal inner product is also applied to impose the continuity conditions of velocity and pressure as well as the free ice edge conditions. Computations are first carried out for a rectangular harbor without the ice sheet to verify the methodology, and then extensive results and discussions are provided for a harbor of a more general shape covered by an ice sheet with different thicknesses and under different incident wave angles.}",

abstract = {Flexural wave scattering plays a crucial role in optimizing and designing structures for various engineering applications. Mathematically, the flexural wave scattering problem on an infinite thin plate is described by a fourth-order plate wave equation on an unbounded domain, making it challenging to solve directly using the regular linear finite element method (FEM). In this paper, we propose two numerical methods, the interior penalty FEM (IP-FEM) and the boundary penalty FEM (BP-FEM) with a transparent boundary condition (TBC), to study flexural wave scattering by an arbitrary-shaped cavity on an infinite thin plate. Both methods decompose the fourth-order plate wave equation into the Helmholtz and modified Helmholtz equations with coupled conditions on the cavity boundary. A TBC is then constructed based on the analytical solutions of the Helmholtz and modified Helmholtz equations in the exterior domain, effectively truncating the unbounded domain into a bounded one. Using linear triangular elements, the IP-FEM and BP-FEM successfully suppress the oscillation of the bending moment of the solution on the cavity boundary, demonstrating superior stability and accuracy compared to the regular linear FEM when applied to this problem.}

The observations reveal that the Wilkins break-ups occur through a distinctive type of shelf calving, which we term ‘disintegration’, as well as more typical rifting and calving. Here we focus on the disintegration process, which is characterized by repeated rapid fracturing that creates narrow ice-edge-parallel blocks, with subsequent block toppling and fragmentation forming an expanding iceberg and ice rubble mass. We use these data to develop and test a model of floating ice plate disintegration in which ice plate bending stresses at the ice front arising from buoyancy forces can lead to runaway calving when free (mobile) water is available. High-resolution satellite images and laser altimetry of the first break-up event provide details of fracture spacings, ice thicknesses, and plate bending profiles that agree well with our model predictions. We suggest that surface or near-surface meltwater is the main pre-condition for disintegration, and that hydro-fracture is the main mechanism. Brine layers from near-waterline brine infiltration can support a similar process, but this is less effective unless regional ice stress patterns contribute to the net stress available at the crack tip for fracturing. A combination of brine-enhanced fracturing and changing internal net extensional stresses was the likely mechanism behind the latter two Wilkins events.}

At the edge of the cavity we consider free-edge, simply-supported and clamped boundary conditions. Methods to suppress ill-conditioning which occurs at certain frequencies are discussed, and the combined boundary integral equation method is implemented to control this problem. A connection is made between the problem of an infinite plate with an arbitrary cavity and the vibration problem of an arbitrarily shaped finite plate, using the jump discontinuity present in single-layer distributions at the boundary. The first few frequencies and modes of displacement are computed for circular and elliptic cavities, which provide a check on our numerics, and results for the displacement of an infinite plate are given for four specific cavity geometries and various boundary conditions.}

The resulting integral representation has a kernel which behaves better on domains with high curvature than existing representations. Thus, this representation results in more robust computational methods for the solution of the Dirichlet problem of the biharmonic equation and we demonstrate this with several numerical examples.},

abstract={The eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Stokes operator have been the subject of intense analytical investigation and have applications in the study and simulation of the Navier--Stokes equations. As the Stokes operator is second order and has the divergence-free constraint, computing these eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenfunctions is a challenging task, particularly in complex geometries and at high frequencies. The boundary integral equation (BIE) framework provides robust and scalable eigenvalue computations due to (a) the reduction in the dimension of the problem to be discretized and (b) the absence of high-frequency ``pollution'' when using Green's function to represent propagating waves. In this paper, we detail the theoretical justification for a BIE approach to the Stokes eigenvalue problem on simply- and multiply-connected planar domains, which entails a treatment of the uniqueness theory for oscillatory Stokes equations on exterior domains. Then, using well-established techniques for discretizing BIEs, we present numerical results which confirm the analytical claims of the paper and demonstrate the efficiency of the overall approach.},

To numerically illustrate the power of elastodynamic transformations, we analyze the elastic response of an elliptic invisibility cloak surrounding a clamped obstacle in the presence of a cylindrical excitation i.e. a concentrated point force. Elliptic cloaking for flexural waves involves a density and an orthotropic Young’s modulus which depend on the radial and azimuthal positions, as deduced from a coordinates transformation for circular cloaks in the spirit of Pendry et al. [Science 312, 1780 (2006)], but with a further stretch of a coordinate axis. We find that a wave radiated by a concentrated point force located a couple of wavelengths away from the cloak is almost unperturbed in magnitude and in phase. However, when the point force lies within the coating, it seems to radiate from a shifted location. Finally, we emphasize the versatility of transformation elastodynamics with the design of an elliptic cloak which rotates the wavevector of a flexural wave within its core.}

The ice floe is modeled as a thin plate, and its motion is expanded in the thin plate modes of vibration. The modes are substituted into the integral equation for the water. This gives a linear system of equations for the coefficients used to expand the ice floe motion. Solutions are presented for the ice floe displacement, the scattered energy, and the time-averaged force for a range of ice floe geometries and wave periods. It is found that ice floe stiffness is the most important factor in determining ice floe motion, scattering, and force.

However, mapping of the grounding line is a challenging task, since it is a subglacial and transient feature. Remote sensing techniques do not map the grounding line directly but locate surface features in the grounding zone that serve as proxies for the true grounding line position. The large variety of methods, products and publications, as well as an inconsistent use of terminology additionally complicate the topic. We present the first detailed review of existing remote sensing techniques and data for grounding line mapping. Benefits and limitations of the different techniques and data sources are discussed and illustrated with examples. We identify a present tradeoff between accuracy and both spatial coverage and temporal resolution of the derived grounding line products. Rather new methods like Sentinel-1-SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) Differential Range Offset Tracking (DROT) and Pseudo Crossover Radar Altimetry (PCRA) offer the potential for recent measurements and to fill gaps in some areas. Nevertheless, there is a high demand of new spaceborne radar sensors that provide time series of very short repeat pass data to enable regular grounding line monitoring with most accurate Differential SAR Interferometry (DInSAR) on a continental scale.}

abstract = {Quantitative relationships between retreating ice cover and the intensification of surface waves in the Arctic Ocean are studied. Wave data are produced by twelve-year (2007—2018) hindcasts of summer melt seasons (from May to September) and numerical tests with WAVEWATCH III. When a viscoelastic wave-ice model and a spherical multiple-cell grid are applied, simulated wave heights agree with available buoy data, altimeter data and previous simulations. Then, with the model data, we find that changes in mean significant wave height of the whole Arctic are dominated by changes in surface winds when the ice extent is larger than 9.4 × 106 km2. If the ice extent retreats from 9.4 × 106 km2, the model predicts that the mean significant wave height will increase by approximately 0.07 m (106 km2)−1 with comparable contributions from both increasing effective fetch and wind speed. For seven Arctic subregions, modeled significant wave height and probabilities of occurrence of large waves (significant wave height > 2 m, 3 m and 4 m) are shown positively correlated with the latitude of ice edge, and for modeled wind sea fraction, it is negatively correlated. With these results, we show the transition of surface waves from wind wave dominated to swell dominated in most of the Arctic sea areas with retreating ice cover. Assuming that the ice-free period occurs in September, the simulations show that mean wave height of the Arctic Ocean will increase to approximately 1.6 m with much more large waves. It implies that there will be a higher growth rate of wave height (m (km2)−1) if the minimum ice extent continues to reduce in the future.}

abstract = {Long-period oceanic infragravity (IG) waves (ca. [250, 50] s period) are generated along continental coastlines by nonlinear wave interactions of storm-forced shoreward propagating swell. Seismic observations on the Ross Ice Shelf show that free IG waves generated along the Pacific coast of North America propagate transoceanically to Antarctica, where they induce a much higher amplitude shelf response than ocean swell (ca. [30, 12] s period). Additionally, unlike ocean swell, IG waves are not significantly damped by sea ice, and thus impact the ice shelf throughout the year. The response of the Ross Ice Shelf to IG-wave induced flexural stresses is more than 60 dB greater than concurrent ground motions measured at nearby Scott Base. This strong coupling suggests that IG-wave forcing may produce ice-shelf fractures that enable abrupt disintegration of ice shelves that are also affected by strong surface melting. Bolstering this hypothesis, each of the 2008 breakup events of the Wilkins Ice Shelf coincides with wave-model-estimated arrival of IG-wave energy from the Patagonian coast.},

These dates (47 of which are new) record a hiatus in driftwood deposition beginning ∼5500 cal yr BP, marking the inception of widespread multiyear landfast sea ice across northern Ellesmere Island. This chronology, together with historical observations of ice shelf breakup (∼1950 to present), provides the only millennial-scale record of Arctic Ocean sea ice variability to which the past three decades of satellite surveillance can be compared. Removal of the remaining ice shelves would be unprecedented in the last 5500 years. This highlights the impact of ongoing 20th and 21st century climate warming that continues to break up the remaining ice shelves and soon may cause historically ice-filled fiords nearby to open seasonally.},

The fracturing caused the drainage of an ice-dammed epishelf lake (Disraeli Fiord), a rare ecosystem type. Reductions in the freshwater volume of Disraeli Fiord occurred from 1967 to the present and accompanied a significant rise in mean annual air temperature over the same period in this far northern region. The recent collapse of ice shelves in West Antarctica has been interpreted as evidence of accelerated climate change in that region. Similarly, the inferred thinning and observed fragmentation of the ice shelf, plus the drainage of the epishelf lake, are additional evidence for climate change in the High Arctic.},

abstract={The cryosphere --- the part of Earth's climate system consisting of snow and ice --- is undergoing rapid and massive perturbations due to planetary warming. For instance, almost half the summer Arctic sea-ice cover has been lost over recent decades; February 2023 saw the extent of Antarctic sea ice reach a record low. Such melting has ripple effects and feedbacks on the climate system that are powerful and can travel far, challenging efforts at modelling and prediction. Five researchers discuss how diverse physics ideas can help better understand the cryosphere.},

    abstract = {Propagation of elastic waves along the axis of cylindrical shells is of great current interest due to their ubiquitous presence and technological importance. Geometric imperfections and spatial variations of properties are inevitable in such structures. Here we report the existence of branched flows of flexural waves in such waveguides. The location of high amplitude motion, away from the launch location, scales as a power law with respect to the variance, and linearly with respect to the correlation length of the spatial variation in the bending stiffness. These scaling laws are then theoretically derived from the ray equations. Numerical integration of the ray equations also exhibit this behaviour—consistent with finite element numerical simulations as well as the theoretically derived scaling. There appears to be a universality for the exponents in the scaling with respect to similar observations in the past for waves in other physical contexts, as well as dispersive flexural waves in elastic plates.},

abstract={Directing and controlling flexural waves in thin plates along a curved trajectory over a broad frequency range is a significant challenge that has various applications in imaging, cloaking, wave focusing, and wireless power transfer circumventing obstacles. To date, all studies appeared controlling elastic waves in structures using periodic arrays of inclusions where these structures are narrowband either because scattering is efficient over a small frequency range, or the arrangements exploit Bragg scattering bandgaps, which themselves are narrowband. Here, we design and experimentally test a wave-bending structure in a thin plate by smoothly varying the plate's rigidity (and thus its phase velocity). The proposed structures are (i) broadband, since the approach is frequency-independent and does not require bandgaps, and (ii) capable of bending elastic waves along convex trajectories with an arbitrary curvature.},

abstract={Flexural elastic waves and sound in solids are of great interest in wide-ranging contexts such as ultrasound in plates, geophysics, ocean engineering, aerospace and automotive structures, and musical acoustics. Despite bending waves being the most important elastic waves for such surface structures, their propagation in the presence of the inevitable non-uniformity is poorly understood. Here we show the branching and focusing behaviour of highly dispersive flexural waves travelling in elastic plates of non-uniform thickness. The thickness profile has isotropically correlated spatial randomness. The correlation length is much larger than the wavelength. The location of wave focusing shows a scaling relationship with randomness, which is consistent with those previously reported in other random media. We show this analytically and numerically. This suggests a universality in the scaling between the location of wave focusing with randomness and the correlation length, regardless of the physics of the waves in question.},

The forced and free dynamic response of plates with cut-outs is formulated. Laminations are assumed to be symmetric about the mid-plane and the plates are considered analytically as homogeneous anisotropic plates. In the method of solution it is assumed that the effect of the cut-out is equivalent to an external loading on the plate. For free vibration, the method leads to an infinite system of frequency equations. Depending upon the accuracy required, a suitable size of the system of frequency equations is selected. Results are given for square, simply-supported composite plates with centrally located square cut-outs for different modulus ratios. A comparison of results obtained from this method for isotropic plates with cut-outs with available literature is made and excellent agreement is obtained.}

abstract = {The calving of floating glaciers to form icebergs is a major form of ice loss from the Antarctic ice sheet. Disintegration of massive, unconfined, seaward extending ice shelves or glacier tongues gives rise to the largest type of iceberg, some of which have horizontal dimensions exceeding 100 km. Several ice tongues are known to exhibit a quasi-cyclic pattern of calving and subsequent regrowth. A mechanism that would seem to explain this type of calving behavior is based on the vibrational characteristics of the system of a buoyant ice plate floating in shallow water. Ocean wave energy, responsible for the motion, is intercepted by the glacier, either directly from open ocean or after transmission through, and subsequent filtering by, sea ice. The glacier also acts as a wave filter, with filtering characteristics depending on the ice thickness. When a dominant frequency occurring in the incident wave spectrum coincides with one of the natural frequencies of the glacier, then a resonant motion will occur. For relatively high modes of oscillation, low level, but sustained cyclic bending stresses may lead to crack propagation and subsequent fatigue failure in the ice. The contribution of other mechanisms which induce tensile stresses in the ice are considered to be very important in an overall view of the calving problem, and some of these mechanisms are discussed in relation to the vibration mechanism. It is possible to view the proposed vibration mechanism as a trigger which raises the resultant stresses in the ice to the point where fracture will occur.},

The method combines a decomposition of the ice shelf displacement profile at a prescribed frequency of motion into mode shapes of free vibrations, a finite-element method for the cavity water motion and a non-local operator to connect to the open ocean. An investigation is conducted into the effects of ice shelf thickening, seabed shoaling and the grounding-line conditions on time-harmonic ice shelf vibrations, induced by regular incident waves in the swell regime. Furthermore, results are given for ice shelf vibrations in response to irregular incident waves by superposing time-harmonic responses, and ocean-to-ice-shelf transfer functions are derived. The findings add to evidence that ice shelves experience appreciable flexural vibrations in response to swell, and that ice shelf thickening and seabed shoaling can have a considerable influence on predictions of how ice shelves respond to ocean waves. }

When bedrock near the grounding line acts as a fulcrum, leverage from the ice shelf dropping at low tide can cause significant (∼1cm) uplift in the first few kilometers of grounded ice. This uplift and the corresponding depression at high tide lead to basal pressure variations of sufficient magnitude to influence subglacial hydrology. Tidal flexure may thus affect basal lubrication, sediment flow, and till strength, all of which are significant factors in ice-stream dynamics and grounding-line stability. Under certain circumstances, our results suggest the possibility of seawater being drawn into the subglacial water system. The presence of seawater beneath grounded ice would significantly change the radar reflectivity of the grounding zone and complicate the interpretation of grounded versus floating ice based on ice-penetrating radar observations.}

In this paper, a unified and fast computational method based on the spectral-geometry method (SGM) is proposed for the first time to investigate the sound radiation characteristics of elastically constrained plates with arbitrary holes, where the open part of the plate is considered as an extremely thin section and the displacement of the plate can be expanded to a modified Fourier series, which deals with the discontinuity of the original cosine function at the elastic constraint boundary by adding additional terms to the conventional Fourier cosine function. The unknown Fourier coefficients are considered as an independent set of generalised coordinates and solved by the Rayleigh-Ritz method. The Rayleigh integral equation for sound radiation is used to calculate the sound radiation of the plate structure. The accuracy of the method in this paper is verified by comparison with the finite element method (FEM). The effect of each parameter on the sound radiation characteristics of the plate with arbitrary holes is investigated by detailed parametric analysis. This paper provides a reference for the application of plates with arbitrary holes in engineering.}

The biharmonic differential equation, representing the basis of the Kirchhoff theory, is decomposed into two Poisson equations. Local boundary integral equations are derived for this system of equations. The meshless approximation based on the moving least-squares method is employed for the implementation. In the case of simply supported plates, it is sufficient to use the local boundary integral equations. For the case of clamped plates we propose to use a combination of the local boundary integral equations and the global ones. Then, two groups of nodal unknowns are computed separately.

abstract = {Abstract Plates governed by Kirchhoff's equation have been analysed by the boundary integral equation method using the fundamental solution of the biharmonic equation. In the case of supported plates, the boundary conditions permit the uncoupling of the field equation into two harmonic equations that originate, due to the nature of the fundamental solution, easier integration kernels and a simpler system of equations. The calculation of bending and twisting moments and transverse shear force can be formed, combining derivatives of the integral equation which defines the expression of the deflection on any point of the plate. The uncoupling of the biharmonic equation into two Poisson's equations involves the discretization of the domain of the studied problems. Nevertheless, the unknown quantity of the problem does not appear in the domain integrations for which a refined discretization is unnecessary. In the paper, however, a numerical alternative is considered to express the domain integral by means of boundary integrals. In this way, we need only discretize the boundary of the plate, making it necessary to solve a supplementary system of equations in order to calculate the coefficients of the approximation carried out.},
